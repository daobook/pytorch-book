# Transfer Learning with Frozen Layers

📚 This guide explains how to **freeze** YOLOv5 🚀 layers when **transfer learning**. Transfer learning is a useful way to quickly retrain a model on new data without having to retrain the entire network. Instead, part of the initial weights are frozen in place, and the rest of the weights are used to compute loss and are updated by the optimizer. This requires less resources than normal training and allows for faster training times, though it may also results in reductions to final trained accuracy.


## Before You Start

Clone this repo and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies, including **Python>=3.8** and **PyTorch>=1.7**.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 # clone repo
$ cd yolov5
$ pip install wandb -qr requirements.txt # install requirements.txt
```

## Freeze Backbone

All layers that match the `freeze` list in train.py will be frozen by setting their gradients to zero before training starts.
https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/58f8ba771e3712b525ca93a1ee66bc2b2df2092f/train.py#L83-L90

To see a list of module names:
```python
for k, v in model.named_parameters():
    print(k)

# Output
model.0.conv.conv.weight
model.0.conv.bn.weight
model.0.conv.bn.bias
model.1.conv.weight
model.1.bn.weight
model.1.bn.bias
model.2.cv1.conv.weight
model.2.cv1.bn.weight
...
model.23.m.0.cv2.bn.weight
model.23.m.0.cv2.bn.bias
model.24.m.0.weight
model.24.m.0.bias
model.24.m.1.weight
model.24.m.1.bias
model.24.m.2.weight
model.24.m.2.bias
```

Looking at the model architecture we can see that the model backbone is layers 0-9:
https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/58f8ba771e3712b525ca93a1ee66bc2b2df2092f/models/yolov5s.yaml#L12-L48

so we define the freeze list to contain all modules with 'model.0.' - 'model.9.' in their names, and then we start training.
```python
    freeze = ['model.%s.' % x for x in range(10)]  # parameter names to freeze (full or partial)
```

## Freeze All Layers

To freeze the full model except for the final output convolution layers in Detect(), we set freeze list to contain all modules with 'model.0.' - 'model.23.' in their names, and then we start training.
```python
    freeze = ['model.%s.' % x for x in range(24)]  # parameter names to freeze (full or partial)
```

## Results

We trained YOLOv5m on VOC on both of the above scenarios, along with a default model (no freezing), starting from the official COCO pretrained `--weights yolov5m.pt`. The training command for all runs was:
```bash
$ train.py --batch 48 --weights yolov5m.pt --data voc.yaml --epochs 50 --cache --img 512 --hyp hyp.finetune.yaml
```

### Accuracy Comparison

The results show that freezing speeds up training, but reduces final accuracy slightly. A full W&B Report of the runs can be found at this link:

### GPU Utilization Comparison

Interestingly, the more modules are frozen the less GPU memory is required to train, and the lower GPU utilization. This indicates that larger models, or models trained at larger --image-size may benefit from freezing in order to train faster.
